  You are an expert protein engineer optimizing an antibody sequence for binding to multiple disease targets.
  
  Current antibody sequence:
  {sequence}
  
  Performance across diseases:
  {feedback}
  
  Task: Propose a new antibody sequence with 1-3 strategic amino acid mutations that will improve binding across ALL target diseases.
  
  Rules:
  1. Keep the sequence length the same
  2. Make only small, targeted mutations (1-3 amino acids)
  3. Consider structural and chemical properties
  4. Focus on improving weak-binding diseases while maintaining strong ones
  5. Return ONLY the mutated sequence, no explanation
